## What's this?

The last Java school project: we had to find a public RESTful api service, and create an app that used it. I took the chance to dive in de world of Swing layouts, and create a fully resizable, dynamic, UI. More than a just dive, it turned out to be quite a *deep sea* dive, but in the end I think it was worth the effort.\
Also, first time using a third-party dependencies to parse the Json response.

*the interface uses the original iron man font, but don't tell anyone, it's a secret!*

## Features

* lot's of layouts! resizeability!
* fun api
* appealing UI

## Curator

* eclipse workspace
* private key removed from source. A private key is required to use the service
